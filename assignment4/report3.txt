Running blur_1.py on the provided beatles.jpg:
$ time python3 blur_1.py

real	0m5,653s
user	0m5,784s
sys	0m0,188s

Running blur_3.py on the same image:
$ time python3 blur_3.py

real	0m0,955s
user	0m1,043s
sys	0m0,230s

Using numba to speed up the for-loops of blur_1.py is several times faster than the naive method, but still not as fast as numpy (see report #2).
